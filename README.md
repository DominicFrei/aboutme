# About me
The quality of work is mainly influenced by three factors: experience, passion, and repetition.

For the past 10+ years I worked mainly on iOS apps. Ever since my youth I was interested in games though.  
While still being active as an iOS developer I am constantly getting more into Unity development.

Therefore, I am available in both areas and would describe myself as a senior iOS and junior Unity developer.
